# Welcome to My GitHub Repository

Hello, I'm [Your Name]! I'm currently pursuing a Master of Information Technology at UNSW, and I completed my undergraduate studies in Data Science at USYD. My passion lies in exploring cutting-edge technologies, and I'm actively expanding my skills in Large Language Models (LLMs), software development, and data science.

## About Me

With a strong background in data science and technology, I strive to be at the forefront of innovation. My journey involves deep dives into machine learning, building robust software solutions, and turning data into actionable insights. I'm particularly focused on LLMs, which are transforming the way we interact with and process natural language.

## Repository Overview

This repository is a collection of my projects, experiments, and learning milestones. Inside, you'll find:

- **Large Language Models:** Hands-on experiments and implementations showcasing the power of LLMs.
- **Software Development:** A variety of projects that highlight my evolving skills in developing scalable and efficient software.
- **Data Science:** Analytical projects, machine learning models, and visualizations that turn raw data into meaningful stories.

## Technologies & Tools

I work with a diverse set of technologies and frameworks, including:

- **Programming Languages:** Python and others as needed.
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, and Hugging Face Transformers.
